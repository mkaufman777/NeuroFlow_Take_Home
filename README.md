# NeuroFlow_Take_Home, Part 1 Instructions

Part 1 of this take home assessment involves the use of a Jupyter Notebook in conjunction with the provided 'subj_measures.csv' file.  In order to run this code locally, download a copy of the notebook and open it within the same directory as a local copy of the 'subj_measures.csv' file to ensure that the notebook can be used to read the file into a dataframe.

Once the notebook is open, make sure that all necessary packages are installed on your computer.  Once installed, you can simply run each cell in the Jupyter Notebook (from top to bottom) to execute code and see the solutions to this section of the take home.
